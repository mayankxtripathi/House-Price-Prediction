# House-Price-Prediction
This project develops a machine learning model to predict home values by preprocessing data, selecting features, and training regression models. Hyperparameters are optimized using grid search, and performance is evaluated with mean squared error and R-squared. The model is fine-tuned for accuracy and validated on unseen data.
